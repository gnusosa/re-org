* ReOrg

An Org mode file organizer.

** Motivation

Instead of having tons of sparsed Org mode files everywhere,
this project attemtps to give the Org mode writer a framework
to re-organize the files in a less chaotic manner.

** Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    gem 're-org'
#+END_SRC

And then execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ bundle
#+END_SRC

Or install it yourself as:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ gem install re-org
#+END_SRC

** Usage

This library uses ~docopt~ so these are self-documenting:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
cat bin/re-org
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
require 'docopt'
require 're-org'
