* ReOrg

An Org mode file organizer.

** Motivation

Instead of having tons of sparsed Org mode files everywhere,
this project attemtps to give the Org mode writer a framework
to re-organize the files in a less chaotic manner.

** Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

#+begin_src sh
    gem 're-org'
#+end_src

And then execute:

#+begin_src sh
    $ bundle
#+end_src

Or install it yourself as:

#+begin_src sh
    $ gem install re-org
#+end_src

** Usage

This library uses ~docopt~ so these are self-documenting:

#+begin_src sh :results output
cat bin/re-org
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
require 'docopt'
require 're-org'
