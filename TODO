- [ ] Allow to use different templates
- [ ] Make it possible to set a =templates/= directory
- [ ] Completed and organized files go to the =orgs= folder.

* COMMENT
** Git integration

Probably too much to put things in Git, fun but not needed.
Haven't thought on a use case for this kind of things.

** OrgRuby integration

This could be interesting, use the library to extract the
metadata from the texts to organize them better.

** Define what is the purpose of the =orgs/= folder

Hmm... Considering my flow:

I open the same file and put everything there infinitely,
until the file grows to big and becomes a bit unmantainable.
Furthermore, I cannot get much insight of my flow from having
such an unmantainable mess.

I guess Org mode could be a great editor for the actual missing
features that it is pointing too.

New flow could be:

- Write on a file and clock it during working time.

- During writing, I could publish what I want from
  the headlines to the OrgHexagon.

- At the end of the day, organize a little bit what I did,
  by specifying PROPERTIES on the main headlines from the texts.
